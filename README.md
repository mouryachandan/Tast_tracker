Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher)

MongoDB (or a MongoDB Atlas account for cloud hosting)

Setup Instructions
Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory.

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
npm install
Create a .env file and set the following environment variables:

env
Copy
Edit
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/task-management # Change if using MongoDB Atlas
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
The backend will be running on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory.

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
npm install
Create a .env file and set the backend API URL:

env
Copy
Edit
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
Start the frontend server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
The frontend will be running on http://localhost:3000.

How to Use
Register/Login: First, register or log in to your account (you can add functionality for user registration/login if not already implemented).

Create Tasks: Once logged in, you can create tasks with a title, description, status, and due date.

Update/Delete Tasks: You can update the task status or delete a task from the list.

View Tasks: All tasks created will be shown in a list, and you can view a specific task by clicking on it.

Deployment
Deploying the Backend
You can deploy the backend on platforms like Heroku or Render.

To deploy on Heroku:

Install the Heroku CLI.

Log in to your Heroku account using heroku login.

Create a new Heroku application:

bash
Copy
Edit
heroku create task-management-app
Push your code to Heroku:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push heroku main
Set the environment variables (like MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET) in the Heroku dashboard or using the CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
heroku config:set MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
heroku config:set JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
Open the deployed app:

bash
Copy
Edit
heroku open
Deploying the Frontend
You can deploy the frontend on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

To deploy on Netlify:

Create a new Netlify project by connecting your GitHub repository.

Choose the build settings (npm run build for the build command and build as the output directory).

Set the REACT_APP_API_URL environment variable to your backend API URL.

Self-Hosting (Bonus)
If you'd like to self-host the application, you can deploy both the backend and frontend on your own server (for example, using Docker, Nginx, or other services). Here's a basic example of how to self-host:

Dockerize the Application:

Create a Dockerfile for both the frontend and backend.

Use Docker Compose to run both containers together.

Run Nginx: Set up Nginx to proxy requests to the backend API and serve the frontend build.
